# ezproxy-abuse-check
Simple script to check ezproxy logs for signs of abuse.

Depending on your log file name/format, there are two things that could need changing
- I put a comment where I'm finding the most recent *.log file out of the rolled logs.
- I also put comments where I'm selecting the 'columns' to use in the log file (whitespace denotes a new column).  It's possible your log file puts columns in a different order.
